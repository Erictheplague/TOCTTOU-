# TOCTTOU-
TOCTTOU  Attack
time-of-check to time-of-use (TOCTOU, TOCTTOU or TOC/TOU) is a class of software bugs caused by a race condition involving the checking of the state of a part of a system (such as a security credential) and the use of the results of that check. 
Time-of-Check-to-Time-of-Use (TOCTTOU) was being publicized by researchers Collin Mulliner and Benjamin Michéle.
The TOCTTOU attack targets one of the most basic security capabilities in consumer electronics:
the ability for the device to ensure that a software update is legitimate and created by
the manufacturer or a trusted third party. This enables the manufacturer to protect its intellec-
tual property and secures the device against malware that can violate the integrity of the soft-
ware or compromise the privacy of the consumer. A good example is the jailbreak community
surrounding Apple’s iOS operating system, which powers the iPhone and the iPad. Apple con-
tinuously builds new security mechanisms to prevent others from being able to modify the
core functionality of its devices, to preserve ownership of the experience of the products and to
prevent malicious applications from infecting the devices. The jailbreak community, on the
other hand, strives to find loopholes in Apple’s security mechanisms so it can modify the
functionality of the devices to install customized tweaks and software not authorized by Apple.
In the case of Smart TVs, manufacturers want to protect their devices from running unauthorized code to protect their intellectual property, to avoid warranty issues caused by users
uploading buggy code, and to protect digital content such as online rental movies from being
recorded. Smart TV users, on the other hand, may want to break the security mechanisms
enforced by manufacturers so they can enable additional tweaks, fix software issues on devices
that are no longer supported by the manufacturer, and perhaps engage in theft by permanently recording rental-based media content.
